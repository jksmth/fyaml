## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Vulnerabilities should be reported via:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred)
   Use the Security tab in this repository to create a private security advisory:
   https://github.com/jksmth/fyaml/security/advisories/new

2. **Fallback contact**
   If GitHub Security Advisories are unavailable for any reason, contact the maintainers via GitHub.

## What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact and severity
- Any relevant logs, payloads, or proof-of-concept
- Suggested mitigation or fix (if known)

Incomplete reports are still welcome, but additional detail helps speed up assessment.

---

## Response and Disclosure Process

This project is maintained by a small team, and response times may vary.

The typical process is:

- **Acknowledgment**: Receipt of the report will be acknowledged as soon as possible (typically within one week)
- **Assessment**: The vulnerability will be reviewed and severity assessed
- **Fix or Mitigation**: A fix or documented mitigation will be developed based on severity and available resources
- **Disclosure**: Public disclosure will be coordinated after a fix or mitigation is available

There are no guaranteed response-time SLAs, but reports will be handled in good faith.

## What Is Considered a Security Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities include, but are not limited to:

- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Authentication or authorization bypass
- Information disclosure or data leakage
- Denial-of-service conditions
- Supply-chain compromise or integrity issues

Issues that do **not** have a security impact (such as feature requests or non-security bugs) should be reported via the GitHub issues tracker instead:
https://github.com/jksmth/fyaml/issues
